Life is finite, and that's what makes it precious. By reminding yourself of this, you can be more conscious about how you spend your time. This wallpaper will constantly provoke the question "if not now, when?". Make sure you make the most of your time on earth by appreciating the full worth of every day.

This app is a live wallpaper which displays the percentage of your life that has already gone by. In addition to giving you the actual numbers, it also provides a visual depiction of your time by filling that same percentage of your screen.

This app was inspired by "Your Life in Weeks", a Wait But Why article by Tim Urban: https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
