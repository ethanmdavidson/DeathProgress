## Death Progress and Life Perspective

This is a live wallpaper for Android. It displays the percentage of your life that has already gone by. 

See the [Google Play Store listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.machinerychorus.lifeprogresswallpaper).

Inspired by [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) by Wait But Why.
If you want to understand the point of this wallpaper, reading this will explain it better than I can.

This is a Kotlin rebuild of the [original Java version](https://github.com/ethanmdavidson/DeathProgressOriginal).
