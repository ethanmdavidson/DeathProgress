## Death Progress and Life Perspective

This is a live wallpaper for Android. It displays the percentage of your life that has already gone by.
It is meant to be an always-present [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori), provoking
you to frequently think about your mortality.

See the [Google Play Store listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.machinerychorus.lifeprogresswallpaper).

Inspired by [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) by Wait But Why.
If you want to understand the point of this wallpaper, reading that will explain it better than I can.

Uses [ColorPickerPreference by skydoves](https://github.com/skydoves/ColorPickerPreference).

### Other thoughts on this topic

> Come to terms with death, thereafter anything is possible

(Albert Camus)

> Death destroys a man: the idea of Death saves him. Behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it. Men of the world may recoil from the charnel-house that they will one day enter, but Love knows better. Death is his foe, but his peer, and in their age-long struggle the thews of Love have been strengthened, and his vision cleared, until there is no one who can stand against him.

(E.M. Forster)

## Roadmap and Feedback

This is a free app, developed in my free time. I do it for fun and for personal use, not for money.
As such, this codebase is subject to my whims. There is no set roadmap, and I will add and remove
features as I see fit, whenever I feel like it. Quality is not guaranteed.

If you have a bug report, please open an issue! While I provide no guarantees, I like
to think that I'm a decent person who ships decent code, and I try to take pride in 
what I do. I want this app to be as bug free as possible.

If there is a feature you would like, please open an issue and we'll talk about it.

PRs are welcome too! I make no promise to accept anything. If it's a big change,
you might want to open an issue to discuss it first so you don't waste a bunch of time
writing a PR I won't accept.

Forking/copying this repo is also encouraged!

## Development

There are no unit tests. There is no documentation other than this file. 
I know, I know, how terrible! shame on me!

- `./gradlew detekt` to run the linter.
- `./gradlew build` to build APKs

## Licensing

This is licensed under the unlicense, since I want this code to be as unencumbered 
and freely available as possible. If you would prefer a different license, just open an issue. 

## Other

This is a Kotlin rebuild of the [original Java version](https://github.com/ethanmdavidson/DeathProgressOriginal).
