=== Personal Information ===

This app does not collect any personal information and does not contain 
any tracking. No information is sent to the developers except for the 
information collected by google (e.g. crash reports). The app only saves 
your preferences on the local device. This app does not require a
license or internet connection.

=== Required Permissions ===

This app requests permission to change your wallpaper in order to make
the "Set this wallpaper" button work. If this permission is denied, 
all other functionality will continue working, and you will still be
able to select this wallpaper in the system settings.
